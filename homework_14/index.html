            <h3><sup>1</sup>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey!
                If you are looking for environment setup instructions, they've
                moved to <u>their own section.</u> Continue reading for an introductions to the
                documentation, Native Components, React, and more!
            </p>
            <h4><sup>2</sup>CORE COMPONENTS</h4>
            <p>React Native is an open source framework for building
                Android and iOS applications using React and the app
                platform's native capabilities. With Reacr Native, you use Java Skript to acces
                your platform's APls as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your
                UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code.
                You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let's cover how components
                work in React Native.
            </p>
            <h4><sup>3</sup>
                REACT FUNDAMENTALS
            </h4>
            <p>
                React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building
                user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to
                understand React itself.
                This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher sourse.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're going to cover the core concepts behind React:
            </p>
            <p>+ components. The rest of this introductions to React uses cats in its examples:
                friendly, approachable
                creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
            </p>
            <p>
                +JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
                JavaScript like so: Text Hello, I am your cat! /Text.
                The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more.
                Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you declaring a
                name for the cat, name,
                and embedding it with curly braces inside Text.
            </p>
            <p>
                + props. Props is short for "properties".
            </p>
            <p>
                + state. Ehile you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
                components render,
                state is like a component's personal data storage. State is useful for handling
                data that changes over time
                or that comes frome user interaction. State gives your components memory!
            </p>
            <h4>
                <sup>4</sup> HANDLING TEXT INPUT
            </h4>
            <p>
                TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                onChange Text prop that takes
                a function to be called avery time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing
                prop that takes a function
                to be called ehen the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, let's say the user types, you're translating their words into
                a different language. In this new language, every single wors is written the same way:
                &#127829;
                pizza. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "&#127829; &#127829;".
