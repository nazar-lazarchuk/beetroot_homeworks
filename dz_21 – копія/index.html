              FashHanger is a bespoke sustainable high-fashion accessory company based
              out of Berlin, currently operated by Siesly and her sister Ashely. They
              needed help for a big rebrand and wanted to relaunch their website.

              Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off the
              Myers Briggs personality test. According to the Myers Briggs, there are
              16 potential user personality types. Our template integrates questions
              from this online personality test example into a series of sliding bar
              graphics. If you’re confused as to what the sliders mean, check out the
              Myers Briggs basics article.

              I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I’m
              working on (and find the parallels later). Personally, I prefer paper
              with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of the time
              perfection isn’t an issue and the sketches are just for me.

              I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you
              in to each screen. For each of those screens I added a floating footer
              that allows users to see where they are in that particular flow and jump
              around as needed.” We’re digging this InVision-made wireframe.
