                        Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! 
                        If you're looking for environment setup instructions, 
                        they've moved to their own section.

                        React Native is an open source framework for building Android and 
                        iOS applications using React and the app<br> platform‚Äôs native 
                        capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access 
                        your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to<br> describe the appearance and 
                        behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, 
                        nestable code. You<br> can learn more about React in the next section. 
                        But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.

                    <p class="text-part">
                        React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for 
                        building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the<br> most of 
                        React Native, it helps to understand React itself. 
                        This section can get you started or can serve as a<br> refresher course.

                    <p class="text-part">
                        We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-part">
                        + components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: 
                        friendly, approachable creatures that<br> need names and a cafe to work in.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-part">
                        + JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                        elements inside JavaScript like so: &#60;Text&#62;Hello, I<br> am your cat!&#60;/Text&#62;.
                        The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn 
                        even more. Because<br> JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. 
                        Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it<br> with curly 
                        braces inside &#60;Text&#62;.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-part">
                        + props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.

                    <p class="text-part">
                        + state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how 
                        components render, state is like a<br> component‚Äôs personal data storage. 
                        State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from<br> user interaction. 
                        State gives your components memory!

                    <span class="t-upper"> Handling Text Input</span>
                    <p class="text-part">
                        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. 
                        It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every 
                        time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function 
                        to be called when the text is submitted.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-part">
                        For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating 
                        their words into a different language. In this new language, every 
                        single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" 
                        would be translated as<br> "üçï üçï".
