          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
            looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
            <span class="underline">their own section. </span>
            Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation, Native
            Components, React, and more!

          <h2>Core Components</h2>
          <p>
            React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
            iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
            capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
            platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
            of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable
            code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But
            first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>React Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>
            React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>
            , a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
            JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to
            understand React itself. This section can get you started or can
            serve as a refresher course.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            + components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in
            its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and
            a cafe to work in.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            + JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
            write elements inside JavaScript like so: &#60;Text&#62;Hello, I
            am your cat!&#60;/Text&#62;. The React docs have
            <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you
            can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can
            use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the
            cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
            &#60;Text&#62;.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>+ props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            + state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to
            configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs
            personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
            changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives
            your components memory!
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Handling Text Input</h2>
          <p>
            TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
            It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called
            every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
            takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
            their words into a different language. In this new language, every
            single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
            there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
