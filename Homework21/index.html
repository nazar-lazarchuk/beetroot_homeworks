          Who is your user? Indicate her KEY personality traits and help round
          out her overall image.

        <h4>
          Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off the
          Myers Briggs personality test. According to the Myers Briggs, there
          are 16 potential user personality types. Our template integrates
          questions from this online personality test example into a series of
          sliding bar graphics. If you are confused as to what the sliders mean,
          check out the Myers Briggs basics article.

        <h4>In the beginning, It&#39;s just about brainstorming.</h4>

        <h4>
          I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what
          I&#39;m working on 
          &#40;and find the parallels later&#41;. Personally, I prefer
          paper with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of the
          time perfection isn&#39;t an issue and the scetches are just for me.

          I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead
          you in to each screen. For each of those screens I added a floating
          footer that allows users to see where they are in that particular flow
          and jump around as needed.‚Äù We are digging this InVision-made
          wireframe.
