                    Android and iOS applications using React and the app
                    platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use
                    JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to
                    describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
                    components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can
                    learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs
                    cover how components work in React Native.</span

                    you write elements inside JavaScript like so:<code
                        >&lt;Text&gt;</code
                    >
                    Hello, I am your cat!<code>&lt;/Text&gt;</code>. The React
                    docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to
                    learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
                    variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the
                    cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces
                    inside<code>&lt;Text&gt;</code>.</span

                    to configure how components render, state is like a
                    component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for
                    handling data that changes over time or that comes from user
                    interaction. State gives your components memory!</span

                    onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when
                    the text is submitted.
