          Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're

          CORE COMPONENTS
        </h2>
        <p class="info__paragraph">
          React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
          applications using React and the app platform’s native capabilities.
          With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs
          as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using
          React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn
          more about React in the next section. But first, let’s cover how
          components work in React Native.

          REACT FUNDAMENTALS
        </h2>
        <p class="info__paragraph">
          React Native runs on <a class="info__link" href="#">React</a>, a
          popular open source library for building user interfaces with
          JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand
          React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a
          refresher course.
        </p>

        <p class="info__paragraph">
          We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:
        </p>

        <p class="info__paragraph">
          + components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
          examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe
          to work in.
        </p>

        <p class="info__paragraph">
          + JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
          elements inside JavaScript like so: &#60;Text&#62;Hello, I am your
          cat!&#60;/Text&#62;. The React docs have a
          <a class="info__link" href="#">comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can
          refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
          variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name,
          and embedding it with curly braces inside &#60;Text&#62;.
        </p>

        <p class="info__paragraph">+ props. Props is short for “properties”.</p>
        <p class="info__paragraph">
          + state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to
          configure how components render, state is like a component’s personal
          data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time
          or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components
          memory!
        </p>

          HANDLING TEXT INPUT
        </h2>
        <p class="info__paragraph">
          TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
          has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time
          the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to
          be called when the text is submitted.
        </p>
        <p class="info__paragraph">
          For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
          their words into a different language. In this new language, every
          single word is written the same way: &#127829;. So the sentence "Hello
          there Bob" would be translated as "&#127829; &#127829;".
