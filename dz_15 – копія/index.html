          <p class="information__paragraph">
            React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
            iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native
            capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
            platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
            of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable
            code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first,
            let’s cover how components work in React Native.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="information" id="react">
          <h2 class="information__title header_of_paragraph">REACT FUNDAMENTALS</h2>
          <p class="information__paragraph">
            React Native runs on
            <a class="information__link" href="#">React</a>, a popular open
            source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make
            the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This
            section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
          </p>

          <p class="information__paragraph">
            We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:
          </p>

          <p class="information__paragraph">
            <b>+ components.</b>The rest of this introduction to React uses cats
            in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names
            and a cafe to work in.
          </p>

          <p class="information__paragraph">
            <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
            write elements inside JavaScript like so:<strong
              >&#60;Text&#62;Hello, I am your cat!&#60;/Text&#62;</strong
            >. The React docs have a
            <a class="information__link" href="#">comprehensive guide to JSX</a>
            you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can
            use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat,
            <strong>name</strong>, and embedding it with curly braces
            inside<strong> &#60;Text&#62;.</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="information__paragraph">
            <b>+ props.</b> Props is short for “properties”.
          </p>

          <p class="information__paragraph">
            <b>state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to
            configure how components render, state is like a component’s
            personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
            changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives
            your components memory!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="information" id="handling">
            <h2 class="information__title header_of_paragraph">HANDLING TEXT INPUT</h2>
            <p class="information__paragraph">
                TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
                has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time
                the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to
                be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>

            <p class="information__paragraph">
                For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
                their words into a different language. In this new language, every
                single word is written the same way: &#127829;. So the sentence "Hello
                there Bob" would be translated as "&#127829; &#127829; &#127829;".
