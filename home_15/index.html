              capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
              platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
              of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable
              code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But
              first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</span

              >React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for
              building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of
              React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
              can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

              write elements inside JavaScript like so:<code>&lt;Text&gt;</code>
              Hello, I am your cat!<code>&lt;/Text&gt;</code>. The React docs
              have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even
              more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it.
              Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it
              with curly braces inside<code>&lt;Text&gt;</code>.</span

              configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs
              personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
              changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives
              your components memory!</span

              It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called
              every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
              takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.

              >For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
              their words into a different language. In this new language, every
              single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
              there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
