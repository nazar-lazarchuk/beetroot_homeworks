          Ready to go “all in,” Virgo? Merging is on your mind all year, as
          expansive Jupiter threads through your seventh and eighth houses of
          relationship. Whether you’re signing a business deal or a lease on a
          2BR love shack, tear up the rule book. Individualistic Jupiter invites
          you to do partnership your way. That may include long-distance living
          or prolonged phases of physical separation, as eclipses spur you to
          travel and gain knowledge of a longtime obsession. But as every Virgo
          knows, true connection is as much about mind and soul as it is about
          the body. Not that you should ignore your physical longings! But with
          stabilizing Saturn in your wellness zone all year, they might lead you
          to a pine-covered hiking trail, or a haute fitness studio where you
          can unwind in the steam room after a kickass session with your
          trainer.

          Self-care means different things to all of us, but in 2022, the
          concept has much less to do with treating yourself and more more to do
          with the 101 basics: working out, eating clean and getting a proper
          night’s rest at least five times a week. Vitality-boosting Jupiter
          kicks off 2022 in your wellness zone where it sets the tone for a
          streamlined, simplified, and stress-busting year. Before you’ve
          polished off your NYD mimosa, you’ll be plotting out your first detox
          and convincing at least five friends to join you. (Hey, how about that
          yoga retreat?) Work gets busy this year too, but thankfully, the sixth
          house rules systems. Before you launch another venture, project, or
          “wouldn’t it be amazing if?” plan, get your structures locked in.
          Write up SOPs, plug your team into apps like Slack, Notion, and
          Trello, and make sure that you have enough support to pull off the
          vision. Your timeline could move a little slower, but at least you
          won’t get burned out by the process!

          Long-buried dreams will haunt you like apparitions, Scorpio, but
          instead of waving them away in a cloud of palo santo smoke, sit down
          with your ghosts for a soulful séance. For the first time since
          2003-4, the moon’s karmic South Node journeys through your sign,
          giving you eighteen powerful months to mine your natural talents and
          bring a few of them out of hiding! Simultaneously, you’ll heal
          trauma-informed habits that have limited you for decades, if not your
          whole life! The end game? Crafting a new identity based on your
          authentic self. People will take notice, so don’t spend all your time
          on that meditation cushion. Global Jupiter flies first-class through
          your fame zone until May 10 (and again after Oct. 28) giving you epic
          reach! Whether you work behind the scenes or on center stage, inspire
          people by sharing your story.

          Re-entry time! After 18 months spent flying under the radar,
          Sagittarians are ready to emerge: stronger and wiser, with a bit more
          wear and tear. Since May 2020, you’ve fielded one karmic lesson after
          another, thanks to the soul-growth-inducing lunar South Node in your
          sign. (For reference, please see: Sagittarius Ms. #freebritney
          Spears.) This cycle comes ‘round once every 18.5 years—and it ends on
          Jan. 18, lifting the cloak of invisibility that’s shrouded you for
          months. As you zoom back onto the galactic grid, you may feel
          disoriented at first. With your ruler peripatetic Jupiter in your
          fourth house of roots until May 10, you may decide to take home on the
          road. (Digital nomad life was made for you!) But don’t stay in any
          spotty WiFi locations from May 10 to Oct. 28. As Jupiter bursts into
          Aries, it brings a surge of fame and attention you haven’t felt for
          twelve years. Get ready for your close-up, Sagittarius!

          Woosh, Aquarius, are you still buzzing from your 2021? Last year, you
          hosted bountiful Jupiter and structure-hound Saturn in your sign, an
          ultra-rare convergence. Not only did this put wind beneath your wings
          but also dropped a safety net under your flight path. Hopefully,
          you’re kicking off 2022 with a greater sense of hope and security.
          While the pace of life slows down considerably now, don’t stop moving.
          Saturn lingers in Aquarius until March 7, 2023, pushing you to master
          your craft. Every step you take is a building block, making you
          stronger and stronger. As Jupiter heads into your sensible second
          house until May 10, you’ll move along a more strategic path instead of
          randomly shooting for the moon. Networking is an Aquarius specialty
          and you’ll have a brilliant chance to flex those muscles from May 10
          to Oct. 28. With unbridled Jupiter kicking it in your cooperative,
          communicative third house, you could start a local organization or
          your own podcast, or both! Just make sure you’re getting your
          important message into the world!

          After a hardworking year, you’re back in your social element,
          Capricorn! New friendships flow in, and for a change, you might not
          feel like focusing every conversation on your work. Explore hobbies,
          have fun for fun’s sake. That said, your networking skills will be in
          fine form, so if you’ve got goals (and what Capricorn doesn’t?) get
          involved in organizations where you have a good shot of meeting people
          who share your ambitions. If you’re ready to change your living
          situation, circle May 10 to Oct. 28 in neon ink. Expansive Jupiter
          pirouettes into your domestic fourth house, which could bring a lucky
          Zillow listing or inspire a stint as a digital nomad. Reconnect to
          relatives and old, dear friends this year. One of them could be the
          roommate, travel buddy, or podcasting partner you’ve been searching
          for!

          Climb off the meditation cushion and see if that power suit still
          fits. (No? Get it tailored or treat yourself to a new one!) The flowy,
          low-key vibes of the past two years have reached their climax—and you,
          Pisces, are about to have the luckiest, most powerful year that you’ve
          had in over a decade! That’s because Jupiter, the planet of good
          fortune, swims two laps through your sign, blessing your trailblazing
          first house with its beams. Circle these dates: Jan. 1 to May 10 and
          again from Oct. 28 to Dec. 20. You got a small taste of this energy
          from May 13 to July 28, 2021, when Jupiter briefly visited your sign.
          Whatever glimmers of promise began then could explode into a fireworks
          display of possibility in the coming year. But don’t rush to formulate
          a plan. Just make a point of planting yourself among fascinating
          people in opportunity-rich locations. As your enchanting sign knows,
          the rest generally takes care of itself. Have your vision board ready
          for a day of major miracles and manifestation, April 12, when Jupiter
          catches up to your ruler Neptune in Pisces for the first time since
          1856!
