        Who is your user? Indicate her KEY personality traits and help round out

        Originally, the personality section of this persona was based off the
        Myers Briggs personality test. According to the Myers Briggs, there are
        16 potential user personality types. Our template integrates questions
        from this online personality test example into a series of sliding bar
        graphics. If you’re confused as to what the sliders mean, check out the
        Myers Briggs basics article.

      <p class="paragraph">
        I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I’m
        working on (and find the parallels later). Personally, I prefer paper
        with a grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of the time
        perfection isn’t an issue and the sketches are just for me.

        I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you
        in to each screen. For each of those screens I added a floating footer
        that allows users to see where they are in that particular flow and jump
        around as needed.” We’re digging this InVision-made wireframe.
